GUVs are a  single [[Lipid Bilayer Structure]], with sizes  that typically range from 10 to 100 microns in diameter, making them easily observable under a light microscope.

### Formation Methods

Different methods exist for GUV preparation, including: 
- **Electroformation**: Applying an [[electric field]] to lipids films.
-  **Hydratation**: Sponteaneous sweilling when hydrating dried lipid films.
- **Microfluidics**

### Lipid Nomenclature
**[[DOPC]]**: Stands for **1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine**. Its a common phospholipid used in model membranes studies. The *PC* part indicates that it has a phosphatidylcholine head group, while *DO* (dioleoyl) indicates the fatty acid chains. 

- **Chain length and saturation of the lipid tails affect the membranes fluidity**
- **Head group chemistry affects membrane curvature, charge, and interaction with external molecules**

## Membrane phase Behavior: Ordered vs Disordered Phases


Lipid membranes can exhibit different thermodynamics phases depending on temperature, composition, and external conditioins. Two commonly mentioned phase states in lipid bilayers are: 
- **Liquid-ordered phase ($L_o$):** Typically associated with cholesterol containing  membranes or saturated lipids. The lipids are highly packed (ordered), but retain some lateral mobility.
- **Liquid-disordered phase ($L_d$):** Lipids have more freedom of movement due to unsaturated hydrocarbon chains the bilayer is more fluid. 


 
## Elastic and Mechanical properties of lipid membranes

Lipids membranes can be described in terms of [[Bending elasticity|bending rigidity]] $\kappa$, [[Surface tension]] $\sigma$, and [[Spontaneous curvature]]. For the case of GUVs, which are large enough to see mechanical deformations, such as shape fluctuations, micropipette aspiration, etc.
