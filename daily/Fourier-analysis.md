 When performing the [[contour analysis of the vesicles]] we want to understand from those fluctuations how to extract information about the physical properties of the vesicle.
We will use mainly quasi-spherical vesicles, so oblate vesicles probably should be decompose differently. 

For a quasi spherical vesicle we will think about the shape change as a perturbation due to the [[Thermal fluctuations]]. We can describe the time dependent radius of the vesicle as:
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{R}(\theta,\phi,t)=\bar{R}(1+ \mathcal{T}(\theta,\phi,t))
\end{align}$$
where $\bar{R}$ is the average radii of the vesicle, and $\mathcal{T}$ is the perturbation respect of the mean shape of the vesicle. This perturbation can be expressed in spherical harmonics
$$\mathcal{T}(\theta,\phi,t)=\sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}}\sum_{m=-l}^{l}u_{lm}(t)\mathcal{Y}_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)$$
With $\mathcal{Y}_{l,m}=n_{lm}\mathcal{P}_{l,m}(\cos{\theta})e^{im\phi}$, with $\mathcal{P}_{l,m}$, the Legendre polynomials and $n_{l,m}=\sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-m)!}{4\pi(l+m)!}}$
the normalization. 

Where the first two modes represents
$$l=0, \ \text{Spherically symmetrical mode}$$
$$l=1, \ \text{Translation without shape change}$$
$$l\geq 2, \ \text{Shape changes}$$
