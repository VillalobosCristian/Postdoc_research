Also called **bending modulus** or $\kappa$, measure of how much energy it costs to bend a membrane. For lipid bilayers typically is around of some $\kappa \propto k_B T$

# Theory
From [[Helfrich-model]]: bending energy $=\kappa/2 \int (C_1+C_2+C_0)^2 dA$, where $C_1,C_2,C_3$ are the principal curvatures, and $C_0$ is the spontaneous curvature.
