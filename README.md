# Physics Research Vault

**Created:** January 2025

## Structure

- `daily/` - Daily lab notes (YYYY-MM-DD.md format)
- `projects/` - Active research projects (one folder per project)
- `papers/` - Literature notes from Zotero
- `protocols/` - Experimental protocols
- `archive/` - Completed projects

## File Naming

- Daily notes: `2025-01-13.md`
- Project notes: `2025-01-13-descriptive-name.md`
- Protocols: `protocol-name.md`
- Paper notes: `@author-year-title.md`

## Workflow

1. Daily work goes in project folders
2. Quick thoughts go in `daily/`
3. When project completes → move to `archive/`
4. Keep it simple, keep it flat
