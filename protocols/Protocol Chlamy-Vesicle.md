To create a dense suspension of the algae. 
- Take $500 \mu$L of the solution with algae.
- Centrifuge 2 min at 100g. Centrifugation will break the flagela so a waiting time is necessary afterwards to re-grow it.
- Remove the supernatant and resuspend in glucose at osmolarity we desired.
- The chlamy are in a solution called **TAP** at 21 mM 
- We wait one hour.
