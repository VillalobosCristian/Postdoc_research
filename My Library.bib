Invading particles have to overcome fluctuating lipid membranes as the first physical barrier. However, the energy and the role of the fluctuation-based particle-membrane interactions during particle uptake are not understood. We tackle this problem by indenting the membrane of differently composed Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) with optically trapped particles until particle uptake. By continuous 1\,MHz tracking and autocorrelating the particle’s positions within 30µs delays for different indentations, the fluctuations’ amplitude, the damping, the mean forces, and the energy profiles were obtained. Remarkably, the uptake energy into a GUV becomes predictable since it increases for smaller fluctuation amplitudes and longer relaxation time. Our observations could be explained by a mathematical model based on continuous suppression of fluctuation modes. Hence, the reduced particle uptake energy for protein-ligand interactions LecA-Gb3 or Biotin-Streptavidin results also from pronounced, low-friction membrane fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Cellular uptake and expulsion of nanoparticles and viruses often involves a substantial particle concentration at the cell membrane. These particles, many of which are distributed across the cell at relatively large distances, cooperate to enter or exit the cell, highlighting the importance of engulfment cooperativity. Here, we explore the cooperative entry and exit of two and multiple distant nanoparticles to and from curved vesicles, representing cellular endocytosis and exocytosis, respectively. We discover indirect engulfment cooperativity between distant nanoparticles wrapped by vesicles, driven by vesicle curvature, which is absent for particles engulfed by a flat bilayer. For the cooperative entry of two identical particles into the vesicle, we identify a counter-intuitive symmetry-breaking in which one fully-engulfed and one non-engulfed particle is more likely than two fully-engulfed or two non-engulfed particles. As a result, with a high concentration of closely-sized external particles, only half of the particles are expected to be successfully internalized by the vesicle, while the remaining half remains unwrapped, and partially engulfed particles are unlikely. In contrast, the cooperative exit of internal particles from the vesicle is characterized by the simultaneous partial engulfment of the particles that are continuously wrapped by the vesicle. This explains how evolution has harnessed membrane curvature for the simultaneous budding of multiple viral particles, a crucial step in viral infection. Our findings for the cooperative entry of multiple particles have significant implication for achieving efficient drug concentration in drug delivery applications.},

These issues motivated us to write a short review of the most recent methodological developments and possible pitfalls. Additionally, since traditional manual analysis can lead to biased results, we have included a discussion on methods for automatic analysis of GUVs. Finally, we discuss possible improvements in the preparation of GUVs containing high cholesterol contents in order to avoid the formation of artifactual cholesterol crystals. We intend this review to be a reference for those trying to decide what parameters to use as well as an overview providing insight into problems not yet addressed or solved.},

Recent attention in this field is now shifting towards exploring the fascinating dynamics of active and passive mixtures. Here we realize active colloidal rafts, composed of a single catalytic particle encircled by several shells of passive microspheres, and assembled via light-activated chemophoresis. We show that the cluster propulsion mechanism transits from diffusiophoretic to diffusioosmotic as the number of colloidal shells increases. Using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we demonstrate that in large clusters self-propulsion emerges by considering the hydrodynamic flow via the diffusioosmotic response of the substrate. The dynamics in our active colloidal rafts are governed by the interplay between phoretic and osmotic effects. Thus, our work highlights their importance in understanding the rich physics of active catalytic systems.},

The inferred interfacial flow velocities reach values of up to 300 μm=s and set up a parabolic flow field in the water film at large distances from the heat source. The slip velocities are found to be much stronger at interfaces covered with nonionic block-copolymers as compared to bare charged glass interfaces. The good agreement of the numbers gathered in Table 1 leads us to the conclusion that the slip velocity on a Pluronic-coated surface is driven by thermo-osmosis on the PEG-water interface. More generally, they confirm the role of the interaction enthalpy for the thermal separation of molecular mixtures [41] and suggest that simple models such as Eq. (4) provide a good description for the Soret data of polymers. Regarding the thermo-osmosis on a glass surface, our findings differ from previous results. The discrepancy probably results from additional contributions to the excess enthalpy, such as structuration of water or rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network, as discussed in Ref. [33]. Our results further suggest that thermoosmotic flows along solid-liquid interfaces may contribute considerably to thermophoretic measurements in thin film geometries and may be harnessed for microfluidic applications.},

However, the optothermal temperature field was merely employed for in-situ manipulation of nanoparticles, its potential for identifying bio-nanoparticles remains largely untapped. Hence, based on the synergistic effect of optothermal manipulation and CRIPSR-based bio-detection, we developed CRISPR-powered optothermal nanotweezers (CRONT). Specifically, by harnessing diffusiophoresis and thermo-osmotic flows near the substrate upon optothermal excitation, we successfully trapped and enriched DNA functionalized gold nanoparticles, CRISPR-associated proteins, as well as DNA strands. Remarkably, we built an optothermal scheme for enhancing CRISPR-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection at single molecule level, while also introducing a novel CRISPR methodology for observing nucleotide cleavage. Therefore, this innovative approach has endowed optical tweezers with DNA identification ability in aqueous solution which was unattainable before. With its high specificity and feasibility for insitu bio-nanoparticle manipulation and identification, CRONT will become a universal tool in point-of-care diagnosis, biophotonics, and bio-nanotechnology.},

First, we investigate the particle trapping near a non-absorbing reflective surface to understand the action of the optical force of annular beam. The results show that the optical force cannot trap the particles near a reflective surface. Second, an annular beam is generated by Gaussian beam shaping with the aid of axicons, which is then used to irradiate and heat a gold film to create an optothermal trap. The induced thermal gradient and thermal convection can bind the particles in the center of the annular spot. The trapping stiffness of the optothermal trap is 8.1 ± 2.9 fN/μm at a laser power of 100 mW.},

  abstract = {A fluid lipid membrane transmits stresses and torques that are fully determined by its geometry. They can be described by a stress- and torque-tensor, respectively, which yield the force or torque per length through any curve drawn on the membrane’s surface. In the absence of external forces or torques the surface divergence of these tensors vanishes, revealing them as conserved quantities of the underlying Euler–Lagrange equation for the membrane’s shape. This review provides a comprehensive introduction into these concepts without assuming the reader’s familiarity with differential geometry, which instead will be developed as needed, relying on little more than vector calculus. The Helfrich Hamiltonian is then introduced and discussed in some depth. By expressing the quest for the energy-minimizing shape as a functional variation problem subject to geometric constraints, as proposed by Guven (2004), stress- and torque-tensors naturally emerge, and their connection to the shape equation becomes evident. How to reason with both tensors is then illustrated with a number of simple examples, after which this review concludes with four more sophisticated applications: boundary conditions for adhering membranes, corrections to the classical micropipette aspiration equation, membrane buckling, and membrane mediated interactions.},

  abstract = {Endocytotic and exocytotic processes are usually studied using particle-vesicle systems in theory, but most of them are electroneutral. Nevertheless, charged particle-vesicle systems are much closer to real biological systems. Therefore, wrapping behaviors of a negatively charged vesicle wrapping a positively charged particle are systematically investigated by a series of 2D dynamical simulations in this article. The competition between the elastic bending energy and the electrostatic energy dictates the vesicle configuration and charge distribution. It is found that only for intermediate charge concentrations and small particle sizes a vesicle can completely engulf the particle. When the charge density is high, the interaction between vesicle and particle is unexpectedly weakened by both the hardening effect of the charged membrane and the effective-transportation-frozen effect of the charged components. When the particle is strongly charged, multi-layer folding conformations are observed. These studies may provide important insights into mechanism of endocytotic and exocytotic processes in biological systems.},

  abstract = {Molecules drift along temperature gradients, an effect called thermophoresis, the Soret effect, or thermodiffusion. In liquids, its theoretical foundation is the subject of a long-standing debate. By using an all-optical microfluidic fluorescence method, we present experimental results for DNA and polystyrene beads over a large range of particle sizes, salt concentrations, and temperatures. The data support a unifying theory based on solvation entropy. Stated in simple terms, the Soret coefficient is given by the negative solvation entropy, divided by               kT               . The theory predicts the thermodiffusion of polystyrene beads and DNA without any free parameters. We assume a local thermodynamic equilibrium of the solvent molecules around the molecule. This assumption is fulfilled for moderate temperature gradients below a fluctuation criterion. For both DNA and polystyrene beads, thermophoretic motion changes sign at lower temperatures. This thermophilicity toward lower temperatures is attributed to an increasing positive entropy of hydration, whereas the generally dominating thermophobicity is explained by the negative entropy of ionic shielding. The understanding of thermodiffusion sets the stage for detailed probing of solvation properties of colloids and biomolecules. For example, we successfully determine the effective charge of DNA and beads over a size range that is not accessible with electrophoresis.},

  abstract = {The biological function of membranes is closely related to their softness, which is often studied through the membranes’ thermally driven fluctuations. Typically, the analysis assumes that the relaxation rate of a pure bending deformation is determined by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and viscous dissipation in the surrounding medium. Here, we reexamine this assumption and demonstrate that viscous flows within the membrane dominate the dynamics of bending fluctuations of nonplanar membranes with a radius of curvature smaller than the Saffman–Delbrück length. Using flickering spectroscopy of giant vesicles made of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC:cholesterol mixtures and pure diblock-copolymer membranes, we experimentally detect the signature of membrane dissipation in curvature fluctuations. We show that membrane viscosity can be reliably obtained from the short time behavior of the shape time correlations. The results indicate that the DPPC:cholesterol membranes behave as a Newtonian fluid, while the polymer membranes exhibit more complex rheology. Our study provides physical insights into the time scales of curvature remodeling of biological and synthetic membranes.},

Here, Janus colloids fuelled only by glucose and light were designed, which can autonomously interact with cell-like compartments and trigger endocytosis. The crucial role played by the far field hydrodynamic interaction arising from the puller/pusher swimming mode and adhesion is evidenced. It is shown that a large contact time between the active particle and the lipid membrane is required to observe the engulfment of a particle inside a floppy giant lipid vesicle. Active Janus colloids showing relatively small velocities and a puller type swimming mode are able to target giant vesicles, deform their membranes and subsequently get stably engulfed. An instability arising from the unbound membrane segment is responsible for the transition between partial and complete stable engulfment. These experiments shed light on the physical criteria required for autonomous active particle engulfment in giant vesicles, which can serve as general principles in disciplines ranging from drug delivery and microbial infection to nanomedecine.},

  abstract = {Transport of microscopic objects across biological membranes usually involves membrane deformation to enclose the object followed by detachment of the engulfed particle. However, in artificial membranes, this last topological remodelling step is in many cases not spontaneous due to the elastic stability of the neck structure formed upon complete particle wrapping. In this work, we use optical trapping to induce the wrapping of a non-adhesive microsphere by the membrane of a giant lipid vesicle and investigate the energetics and dynamics of the resulting neck structure. We find that neck formation occurs as a result of membrane shape energy minimization under the application of external force. Remarkably, increasing membrane tension could reopen the neck and reverse the wrapping process. This process shows a clear hysteresis and a degree of reversibility. Neck cleavage and particle detachment into the vesicle's interior could not be triggered in the range of our optical forces. Systematic studies on the thermal dynamics of wrapped particles allowed to establish that diffusion properties of the system are in agreement with a coupling of the particle motion with the neck structure, modeled as a solid inclusion within the membrane. Interestingly, the wrapped particle dynamics exhibited a tension dependency, which can be described as the sum of several drag contributions.},

We trigger thermo-osmotic flows by modulating the van der Waals and double layer interactions at a gold-liquid interface with optically generated local temperature fields. The hydrodynamic flows, attractive van der Waals and repulsive double layer forces acting on the suspended nanoparticles enable precise nanoparticle positioning and guidance. A rapid multiplexing of flow fields permits the parallel manipulation of many nano-objects and the generation of complex flow fields.

Here we propose an exhaustive description of the cluster dynamics in apolar active matter. Exploiting large statistics gathered on thousands of Janus colloids, we measure the aggregation and fragmentation rates and rationalize the resulting cluster size distribution and fluctuations. We also show that the motion of individual clusters is entirely consistent with a model positing random orientation of colloids. Our findings establish a simple, generic model of cluster phase, and pave the way for a thorough understanding of clustering in active matter.},

Pushers and pullers show an increased tendency to be captured by the wall with increasing initial swimming angle of the microswimmer. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of the swimming patterns of natural microswimmers near walls and are of substantial importance for the design of artificial microswimmers and microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {A quasi-spherical vesicle changes its shape to an oblate one at vanishing fluctuation surface tension.           ,                             It has been known for long that the fluctuation surface tension of membranes               r               , computed from the height fluctuation spectrum, is not equal to the bare surface tension               σ               , which is introduced in the theory either as a Lagrange multiplier to conserve the total membrane area or as an external constraint. In this work we relate these two surface tensions both analytically and numerically. They are also compared to the Laplace tension               γ               , and the mechanical frame tension               τ               . Using the Helfrich model and one-loop renormalisation calculations, we obtain, in addition to the effective bending modulus               κ               eff               , a new expression for the effective surface tension               σ               eff               =               σ               −               εk               B               T               /(2               a               p               ) where               k               B               T               is the thermal energy,               a               p               the projected cut-off area, and               ε               = 3 or 1 according to the allowed configurations that keep either the projected area or the total area constant. Moreover we show that the crumpling transition for an infinite planar membrane occurs for               σ               eff               = 0, and also that it coincides with vanishing Laplace and frame tensions. Using extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, triangulated membranes of vesicles made of               N               = 100–2500 vertices are simulated within the Helfrich theory. As compared to alternative numerical models, no local constraint is applied and the shape is only controlled by the constant volume, the spontaneous curvature and               σ               . It is shown that the numerical fluctuation surface tension               r               is equal to               σ               eff               both with radial MC moves (               ε               = 3) and with corrected MC moves locally normal to the fluctuating membrane (               ε               = 1). For finite vesicles of typical size               R               , two different regimes are defined: a tension regime for                              eff               =               σ               eff               R               2               /               κ               eff               {$>$} 0 and a bending one for −1 {$<$}                              eff               {$<$} 0. A shape transition from a quasi-spherical shape imposed by the large surface energy, to more deformed shapes only controlled by the bending energy, is observed numerically at                              eff               ≃ 0. We propose that the buckling transition, observed for planar supported membranes in the literature, occurs for                              eff               ≃ −1, the associated negative frame tension playing the role of a compressive force. Hence, a precise control of the value of               σ               eff               in simulations cannot but enhance our understanding of shape transitions of vesicles and cells.},

This review highlights the role of neutron scattering, among other approaches, in uncovering the dynamic properties of lipid membranes.           ,              Cell membranes – primarily composed of lipids, sterols, and proteins – form a dynamic interface between living cells and their environment. They act as a mechanical barrier around the cell while selectively facilitating material transport, signal transduction, and various other functions necessary for the cell viability. The complex functionality of cell membranes and the hierarchical motions and responses they exhibit demand a thorough understanding of the origin of different membrane dynamics and how they are influenced by molecular additives and environmental cues. These dynamic modes include single-molecule diffusion, thermal fluctuations, and large-scale membrane deformations, to name a few. This review highlights advances in investigating structure-driven dynamics associated with model cell membranes, with a particular focus on insights gained from neutron scattering and spectroscopy experiments. We discuss the uniqueness of neutron contrast variation and its remarkable potential in probing selective membrane structure and dynamics on spatial and temporal scales over which key biological functions occur. We also present a summary of current and future opportunities in synergistic combinations of neutron scattering with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex membrane functions.},

Three types of strain, i. e. stretching, tilt and curvature, are distinguished and the associated stresses are identified. It is argued that in the case of vesicles (= closed bilayer films) the only elasticity controlling nonspherical shapes is that of curvature. Euler-Lagrange equations are derived for the shape in magnetic fields and under excess outside pressure. It is shown that magnetic fields can deform spherical vesicles into ellipsoids of revolution. Under excess outside pressure the spherical shape becomes unstable at a certain threshold pressure. Both effects can be influenced by a spontaneous curvature of the bilayer. Some possible experiments to determine the elastic properties are also discussed},

  abstract = {Lipid vesicles are important biological assemblies, which are critical to biological transport processes, and vesicles prepared in the lab are a workhorse for studies of drug delivery, protein unfolding, biomolecular interactions, compartmentalized chemistry, and stimuli-responsive sensing. The current method of using optical tweezers for holding lipid vesicles in place for single-vesicle studies suffers from limitations such as high optical power, rigorous optics, and small difference in the refractive indices of vesicles and water. Herein, we report the use of plasmonic heating to trap vesicles in a temperature gradient, allowing long-range attraction, parallel trapping, and dynamic manipulation. The capabilities and limitations with respect to thermal effects on vesicle structure and optical spectroscopy are discussed. This simple approach allows vesicle manipulation using down to 3 orders of magnitude lower optical power and at least an order of magnitude higher trapping stiffness per unit power than traditional optical tweezers while using a simple optical setup. In addition to the benefit provided by the relaxation of these technical constraints, this technique can complement optical tweezers to allow detailed studies on thermophoresis of optically trapped vesicles and effects of locally generated thermal gradients on the physical properties of lipid vesicles. Finally, the technique itself and the large-scale collection of vesicles have huge potential for future studies of vesicles relevant to detection of exosomes, lipid-raft formation, and other areas relevant to the life sciences.},

  abstract = {Living systems are generally thought to have emerged from inorganic and organic compounds through the formation of compartments (molecular assemblies such as vesicles) and “information molecules” in processes driven by metabolic reaction networks.           ,                             In contrast to ordinary condensed matter systems, “living systems” are unique. They are based on molecular compartments that reproduce themselves through (i) an uptake of ingredients and energy from the environment, and (ii) spatially and timely coordinated internal chemical transformations. These occur on the basis of instructions encoded in information molecules (DNAs). Life originated on Earth about 4 billion years ago as self-organised systems of inorganic compounds and organic molecules including macromolecules (               e.g.               nucleic acids and proteins) and low molar mass amphiphiles (lipids). Before the first living systems emerged from non-living forms of matter, functional molecules and dynamic molecular assemblies must have been formed as prebiotic soft matter systems. These hypothetical cell-like compartment systems often are called “protocells”. Other systems that are considered as bridging units between non-living and living systems are called “minimal cells”. They are synthetic, autonomous and sustainable reproducing compartment systems, but their constituents are not limited to prebiotic substances. In this review, we focus on both membrane-bounded (vesicular) protocells and minimal cells, and provide a membrane physics background which helps to understand how morphological transformations of vesicle systems might have happened and how vesicle reproduction might be coupled with metabolic reactions and information molecules. This research, which bridges matter and life, is a great challenge in which soft matter physics, systems chemistry, and synthetic biology must take joined efforts to better understand how the transformation of protocells into living systems might have occurred at the origin of life.},

  abstract = {Colloidal matter with a wide range of materials, sizes, and configurations was built with opto-thermophoretic assembly.           ,              Colloidal matter exhibits unique collective behaviors beyond what occurs at single-nanoparticle and atomic scales. Treating colloidal particles as building blocks, researchers are exploiting new strategies to rationally organize colloidal particles into complex structures for new functions and devices. Despite tremendous progress in directed assembly and self-assembly, a truly versatile assembly technique without specific functionalization of the colloidal particles remains elusive. We develop a new strategy to assemble colloidal matter under a light-controlled temperature field, which can solve challenges in the existing assembly techniques. By adding an anionic surfactant (that is, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride), which serves as a surface charge source, a macro ion, and a micellar depletant, we generate a light-controlled thermoelectric field to manipulate colloidal atoms and a depletion attraction force to assemble the colloidal atoms into two-dimensional (2D) colloidal matter. The general applicability of this opto-thermophoretic assembly (OTA) strategy allows us to build colloidal matter of diverse colloidal sizes (from subwavelength scale to micrometer scale) and materials (polymeric, dielectric, and metallic colloids) with versatile configurations and tunable bonding strengths and lengths. We further demonstrate that the incorporation of the thermoelectric field into the optical radiation force can achieve 3D reconfiguration of the colloidal matter. The OTA strategy releases the rigorous design rules required in the existing assembly techniques and enriches the structural complexity in colloidal matter, which will open a new window of opportunities for basic research on matter organization, advanced material design, and applications.},

  abstract = {The study of interactions between biomimetic membranes and micron-sized particles serves as a fundamental cornerstone for understanding various biological processes. Here, we aim at controlling the engulfment of microparticles in absence of any externally applied force. We investigate systems involving particles and lipid vesicles, where interactions are primarily mediated by electrostatics. Our attention is directed towards dissipative phenomena at the micron and nano scales occurring between a vesicle membrane and a particle, highlighting the influence of the particle penetration depth and the impact of substructures on particle friction. Our work is complemented by hydrodynamic simulations considering the impacts of the shape of the membrane wrapping the particle and the water gap separating the lipid bilayer membrane and the particle on the translational particle drag. Lastly, we explore a system of aqueous microdroplets in oil, stabilized by a single lipid layer and compare the friction experienced by a particle in contact with this monolayer to the friction observed for particles wrapped by lipid bilayers. Surprisingly, the particle drag is higher on the lipid monolayer than the bilayer, which can be explained by introducing a drag contribution due to the partial wetting dynamics of the particle at the monolayer interface.},

Taking advantage of the well-known quasi-spherical model of liposome flickering, we analyze the full probability distributions of the configurational fluctuations instead of limiting the analysis to the second moment measurements only as usually done in previously published works. This leads to objective criteria to reject vesicles that do not behave according to the model. As a result, the confidence in the bending elasticity determination of individual vesicles that fit the model is improved and, consequently, the reproducibility of this measurement for a given membrane system. This approach uncovers new possibilities for bending elasticity studies like detection of minute influences by solutes in the buffer or into the membrane. In the same way, we are now able to detect the inhomogeneous behavior of giant vesicle systems such as the hazardous production of peroxide in bilayers containing fluorescent dyes.},

A coherent physical theory for the dynamics is developed based on a number of fundamental principles and considerations, and a systematic formulation of the theory is also established. From the systematic theoretical formulation, an analytical description of the dynamics of shape fluctuations of quasi-spherical vesicles is derived. In particular, in developing the theory we have made a new interpretation of some of the phenomenological constants in a canonical continuum description of fluid lipid-bilayer membranes and shown the consequences of this new interpretation in terms of the characteristics of the dynamics of vesicle shape fluctuations. Moreover, we have used the systematic formulation of our theory as a framework against which we have discussed the previously existing theories and their discrepancies. Finally, we have made a systematic prediction about the system-dependent characteristics of the relaxation dynamics of shape fluctuations of quasi-spherical vesicles with a view of experimental studies of the phenomenon and also discussed, based on our theory, a recently published experimental work on the topic.},

The free energy profiles thus computed are taken as input to a stochastic model of the wrapping process, described by a Fokker-Planck equation. We compute average uptake rates of the particle into the vesicle. We find that the rate of particle uptake falls to zero outside of a thermodynamically allowed range of particle sizes. Within the thermodynamically allowed range of particle size, the rate of uptake is variable and we compute the optimal particle size and maximal uptake rate as a function of the attraction strength, the vesicle size, and vesicle material properties.},

Secondly, we provide a conceptual guide on how to develop CGMS.

However, the high laser power involved in optical trapping can damage biological samples. In this context, indirect trapping of microparticles and objects using fluid flow fields has assumed great importance. It has recently been shown that cells and particles can be turned in the pitch sense by opto-plasmonic heating of a gold surface constituting one side of a sample chamber. We extend that work to place two such hotspots in close proximity to each other to form a very unique configuration of flow fields forming an effective quasi-three-dimensional ‘trap’, assisted by thermophoresis. This is effectively a harmonic trap confining particles in all three dimensions without relying on other factors to confine the particles close to the surface. We use this to show indirect trapping of different types of upconverting particles and cells, and also show that we can approach a trap stiffness of 40 fN μm−1 indicating a weak confinement regime without relying on feedback.},

An analysis at higher q vectors than previously achievable is now possible due to technical improvements of the experimental setup and of the detection algorithm. The global fluctuation spectrum is directly fitted to deduce the membrane tension and the bending modulus of lipid membranes. Moreover, we show that the planar analysis of fluctuations is valid for spherical objects, even at low wave vectors. Corrections due to the integration time of the video camera and to the section of a 3D object by the observation plane are introduced. A precise calculation of the error bars has been done in order to provide reliable error estimate. Eventually, using this technique, we have measured bending moduli for EPC, SOPC and SOPC : CHOL membranes confirming previously published values. An interesting application of this technique can be the measurement of the fluctuation spectra for non-equilibrium membranes, such as “active membranes”.},

There are many circumstances in which the deformations of lipid membranes are involved in living cells: fusion and fission, membrane-mediated interaction between membrane inclusions, lipid–protein interaction, formation of pores, etc. In all of these cases, elastic parameters of lipid membranes are important for the description of membrane deformations, as these parameters determine energy barriers and characteristic times of membrane-involved phenomena. Since the development of molecular dynamics (MD), a variety of in silico methods have been proposed for the determination of elastic parameters of simulated lipid membranes. These MD methods allow for the consideration of details unattainable in experimental techniques and represent a distinct scientific field, which is rapidly developing. This work provides a review of these MD approaches with a focus on theoretical aspects. Two main challenges are identified: (i) the ambiguity in the transition from the continuum description of elastic theories to the discrete representation of MD simulations, and (ii) the determination of intrinsic elastic parameters of lipid mixtures, which is complicated due to the composition–curvature coupling effect.},

Using precisely controlled laser-induced temperature gradients, we assemble highly ordered colloidal crystals within minutes, significantly faster than conventional equilibrium approaches. These structures exhibit tunable photonic stopbands that can be modulated by adjusting the laser power, causing structural transitions between crystalline and toroidal configurations. By quantifying the underlying particle fluxes and growth dynamics, we develop a model that accurately predicts assembly rates across different conditions.

  abstract = {Colloidal crystal plays a major role in novel optical devices such as waveguides, photonic crystals, and colloidal crystal lasers, among others. It has been known that colloidal crystals may self-assemble due to optical, electric, or chemical potentials, and light-induced thermal effects, such as thermophoresis and convective currents. In this work, the formation and manipulation of a self-limiting assembly of monolayer colloidal crystals using a 20 nm absorbing thin film of titanium and a CW-laser emitting at 1070 nm is reported. The colloidal particles, dragged by thermally induced convective currents, self-assembling over the titanium thin film around the laser focal spot. The self-assembled monolayer colloidal crystal tends to form a circular shape. Using numerical simulation, we obtained a potential well associated with the convective currents that spatially govern the radial extension of the monolayer colloidal crystal. We also show, that by changing the pH of the solution i.e., by tuning the electrostatic interaction, the monolayer colloidal crystal can be formed or destroyed. In addition, it was possible to create a larger monolayer colloidal structure covering an area of 600 μm2 using an array of six laser spots.},

  abstract = {This computational study shows that the interactions between nanoparticles and vesicles of diverse shapes are influenced not just by particle size and the extent of wrapping, but also by their initial positions and the sequence of interactions.           ,              Nanoparticles present in various environments can interact with living organisms, potentially leading to deleterious effects. Understanding how these nanoparticles interact with cell membranes is crucial for rational assessment of their impact on diverse biological processes. While previous research has explored particle–membrane interactions, the dynamic processes of particle wrapping by fluid vesicles remain incompletely understood. In this study, we introduce a force-based, continuum-scale model utilizing triangulated mesh representation and discrete differential geometry to investigate particle–vesicle interaction dynamics. Our model captures the transformation of vesicle shape and nanoparticle wrapping by calculating the forces arising from membrane bending energy and particle adhesion energy. Inspired by cell phagocytosis of large particles, we focus on establishing a quantitative understanding of large-scale vesicle deformation induced by the interaction with particles of comparable sizes. We first examine the interactions between spherical vesicles and individual nanospheres, both externally and internally, and quantify energy landscapes across different wrapping fractions of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, we explore multiple particle interactions with biologically relevant fluid vesicles with nonspherical shapes. Our study reveals that initial particle positions and interaction sequences are critical in determining the final equilibrium shapes of the vesicle–particle complexes in these interactions. These findings emphasize the importance of nanoparticle positioning and wrapping fractions in the dynamics of particle–vesicle interactions, providing crucial insights for future research in the field.},

The particles, which are “thermophilic,” move towards the laser spot solely because of thermophoresis with no convection effects, forming dense clusters whose structure is monitored using two order parameters that gauge the local density and the orientational ordering. We find that ordering takes place when the cluster reaches an average surface density that is still below the upper equilibrium limit for the fluid phase of hard disks, meaning that we do not detect any sign of a proper “two-stage” nucleation from a glass or a polymorphic crystal structure. The crystal obtained at late growth stage displays a remarkable uniformity with a negligible amount of defects, arguably because the incoming particles diffuse, bounce, and displace other particles before settling at the crystal interface. This “fluidization” of the outer crystal edge may resemble the surface enhanced mobility giving rise to ultra-stable glasses by physical vapor deposition.},

However, the precise physical mechanisms of this coupling remain unclear. Here we show how cytoskeletal forces acting on a biomimetic membrane affect its deformations. Using a minimal cell model that consists of an active network of microtubules and molecular motors encapsulated inside lipid vesicles, we observe large shape fluctuations and travelling membrane deformations. Quantitative analysis of membrane and microtubule dynamics demonstrates how active forces set the temporal scale of vesicle fluctuations, giving rise to fluctuation spectra that differ in both their spatial and temporal decays from their counterparts in thermal equilibrium. Using simulations, we extend the classical framework of membrane fluctuations to active cytoskeleton-driven vesicles, demonstrating how correlated activity governs membrane dynamics and the roles of confinement, membrane material properties and cytoskeletal forces. Our findings provide a quantitative foundation for understanding the shape-morphing abilities of living cells.},

Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension.},

Time-series micrographs of the vesicle shrinkage show uptake rates that are a highly nonlinear function of temperature. A global maximum appears close to the main structural phase transition at T = Tm + 3 K = 37 °C and a minor peak at the pretransition T = Tp = 22 °C. The quality of linear fits to the shrinkage, and thus uptake kinetics, reveals a deviation from the linear trend at the vesicle shrinkage peaks. Taking values for the bending modulus as a function of temperature from literature and Helfrich’s model allows us to draw qualitative conclusions on the membrane tension and the adhesion of the NP to the membrane as a function of temperature. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between temperature, membrane phase transitions, and NP uptake, shedding light on the complex behavior of biological membranes.},

We consider the shape fluctuations of such systems constrained by fixed area A and fixed volume V , whose geometry is presented in terms of scalar spherical harmonics. These constraints can be incorporated in the theory in different ways. After an introductory review of the two approaches: with an exactly fixed by delta-function membrane area A [Seifert, Z. Phys. B, 97, 299, (1995)] or approximatively by means of a Lagrange multiplier σ conjugated to A [Milner and Safran, Phys. Rev. A, 36, 4371 (1987)], we discuss the determined role of the stretching effects, that has been announced in the framework of a model containing stretching energy term, expressed via the membrane vesicle tension [Bivas and Tonchev, Phys.Rev.E, 100, 022416 (2019)]. Since the fluctuation spectrum for the used Hamiltonian is not exactly solvable an approximating method based on the Bogoliubov inequalities for the free energy has been developed. The area constraint in the last approach appears as a self-consistent equation for the membrane tension. In the general case this equation is intractable analytically. However, much insight into the physics behind can be obtained either imposing some restrictions on the values of the model parameters, or studying limiting cases, in which the selfconsistent equation is solved. Implications for the equivalence of ensembles have been discussed as well.},

The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semianalytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems.

As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.},

As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation~for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external- force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.},

  abstract = {Understanding interactions between microparticles and lipid membranes is of increasing importance, especially for unraveling the influence of microplastics on our health and environment. Here, we study how a short-ranged adhesive force between microparticles and model lipid membranes causes membrane-mediated particle assembly. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the initial particle attachment to the membrane, then particle wrapping, and in rare cases spontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the particle mobility decreases by 26\%. If multiple particles adhere to the same vesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and subsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small adhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly attract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped and attached particles form membrane-mediated dimers, which further assemble into a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct assembly pathways, induced only by a short-ranged membrane-particle adhesion, shows that a cytoskeleton or other active components are not required for microparticle aggregation. We suggest that this membrane-mediated microparticle aggregation is a reason behind reported long retention times of polymer microparticles in organisms.},

Vesicles assemble naturally within cells but can also be artificially synthesized. In this article, we review the mechanisms and applications of light-field interactions with vesicles. By being associated with light-emitting entities (e.g., dyes, fluorescent proteins, or quantum dots), vesicles can act as imaging agents in addition to cargo carriers. Vesicles can also be optically probed on the basis of their nonlinear response, typically from the vesicle membrane. Light fields can be employed to transport vesicles by using optical tweezers (photon momentum) or can directly perturb the stability of vesicles and hence trigger the delivery of the encapsulated payload (photon energy). We conclude with emerging vesicle applications in biology and photochemical microreactors.},

  abstract = {Suspensions of self-propelled objects represent a novel paradigm in colloidal science. In such “active baths,” traditional concepts such as Brownian motion, fluctuation–dissipation relations, and work extraction from heat reservoirs, must be extended beyond the conventional framework of thermal baths. Unlike thermal baths, which are characterized by a single parameter, the temperature, the fundamental descriptors of an active bath remain elusive. Particularly relevant are confined environments, which are common conditions for bacteria in Nature and in microbioreactor devices. In this study, buoyant passive tracers are employed as generalized probes to extract the properties of an active bath comprising motile bacteria confined within a droplet. By describing the bacterial suspension as a colored noise acting on the tracer, we extract the temporal memory                                                                        τ                     b                                                                  and characteristic intensity                                                                        u                     b                                                                  of such noise, finding that                                                                        τ                     b                                                                  varies little across the explored experimental conditions and                                                                        u                     b                                                                  is positively correlated with bacterial concentration.

Due to technical limitations, experimental studies have focused independently on either the corolla formation or the deformation inside the granular bed. Hence, so far, it has not been possible to link these two processes. Here, we present an original experiment that allows us to simultaneously observe the granular dynamics above and below the granular layer in microgravity conditions. The crater morphology is studied considering the dependency on the impact energy, grain size, and shape of the projectile. The results show that this type of experimental configuration makes it possible to quantify the effects of projectile geometry in the crater cavity, something that cannot be captured in traditional tridimensional (3D) deep layer experiments or without the help of advanced imaging techniques such as high-speed X-ray radiography. Finally, this setup opens a new way to study the possible effects of collisions between micrometer-sized dust grains under microgravity conditions, a fundamental process in the early formation of planets in protoplanetary disks.},

We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations.},

Currently, giant vesicles are applied to investigate certain aspects of biomembranes. Examples include lateral lipid heterogeneities, membrane budding and fission, activities of reconstituted membrane proteins, or membrane permeabilization caused by added chemical compounds. One of the challenging applications of giant vesicles include gene expressions inside the vesicles with the ultimate goal of constructing a dynamic artificial cell‐like system that is endowed with all those essential features of living cells that distinguish them from the nonliving form of matter. Although this goal still seems to be far away and currently difficult to reach, it is expected that progress in this and other fields of giant vesicle research strongly depend on whether reliable methods for the reproducible preparation of giant vesicles are available. The key concepts of currently known methods for preparing giant unilamellar vesicles are summarized, and advantages and disadvantages of the main methods are compared and critically discussed.},

In this work, we study the transverse forces of an optothermal trap in front of a gold film, which is an absorbing reflective surface for the incident laser beam. It is demonstrated that optothermal forces can be divided into two parts: optical force of a standing-wave trap, and thermal force of a thermal trap. The optical force of the standing-wave trap can be obtained by measuring the optical trapping force close to a non-absorbing film with same reflectance. The thermal force can be obtained by subtracting the optical force of the standing-wave trap from the total trapping force of the optothermal trap close to the gold film. The results show that both optical and thermal trapping forces increase with laser power increasing. The optical trapping force is larger than the thermal trapping force, which is composed of convective drag force and thermophoretic force. Further experiment is run to study the composition of thermal force. The result shows that the convective flow is generated later than the thermophoretic flow. The results proposed here are useful for enabling users to optimize optothermal manipulation method for future applications.},

Here, we present a combined experimental and numerical study in which we quantify these interactions directly for the first time. In our experimental model system we control the deformation of a lipid membrane by adhering colloidal particles. Using confocal microscopy, we establish that these membrane deformations cause an attractive interaction force leading to reversible binding. The attraction extends over 2.5 times the particle diameter and has a strength of three times the thermal energy (−3.3 kBT). Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations of the system are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and prove that the measured interaction is independent of length scale. Our combined experimental and numerical results reveal membrane curvature as a common physical origin for interactions between any membrane-deforming objects, from nanometre-sized proteins to micrometresized particles.},

We furthermore demonstrate how this thinning is associated with a significant decrease in free energy due to the thermally excited bending modes. We argue that this previously unexplored effect can explain the experimentally observed lower limit of achievable vesicle sizes, which eventually become unstable due to the thinning of the bilayer.

  abstract = {A temperature gradient acts like an external field on colloidal suspensions and drives the solute particles to the cold or to the warm, depending on interfacial and solvent properties. We discuss different transport mechanisms for charged colloids, and how a thermal gradient gives rise to companion fields. Particular emphasis is put on the thermal response of the electrolyte solution: positive and negative ions diffuse along the temperature gradient and thus induce a thermoelectric field which in turn acts on the colloidal charges. Regarding polymers in organic solvents, the physical mechanism changes with decreasing molecular weight: high polymers are described in the framework of macroscopic hydrodynamics; for short chains and molecular mixtures of similar size, the Brownian motion of solute and solvent becomes important.},

  abstract = {Erythrocytes (red blood cells) play an essential role in the respiratory functions of vertebrates, carrying oxygen from lungs to tissues and CO2 from tissues to lungs. They are mechanically very soft, enabling circulation through small capillaries. The small thermally induced displacements of the membrane provide an important tool in the investigation of the mechanics of the cell membrane. However, despite numerous studies, uncertainties in the interpretation of the data, and in the values derived for the main parameters of cell mechanics, have rendered past conclusions from the fluctuation approach somewhat controversial. Here we revisit the experimental method and theoretical analysis of fluctuations, to adapt them to the case of cell contour fluctuations, which are readily observable experimentally. This enables direct measurements of membrane tension, of bending modulus, and of the viscosity of the cell cytoplasm. Of the various factors that influence the mechanical properties of the cell, we focus here on: 1), the level of oxygenation, as monitored by Raman spectrometry; 2), cell shape; and 3), the concentration of hemoglobin. The results show that, contrary to previous reports, there is no significant difference in cell tension and bending modulus between oxygenated and deoxygenated states, in line with the softness requirement for optimal circulatory flow in both states. On the other hand, tension and bending moduli of discocyte- and spherocyteshaped cells differ markedly, in both the oxygenated and deoxygenated states. The tension in spherocytes is much higher, consistent with recent theoretical models that describe the transitions between red blood cell shapes as a function of membrane tension. Cell cytoplasmic viscosity is strongly influenced by the hydration state. The implications of these results to circulatory flow dynamics in physiological and pathological conditions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Optical tweezers and associated manipulation tools in the far field have had a major impact on scientific and engineering research by offering precise manipulation of small objects. More recently, the possibility of performing manipulation with surface plasmons has opened opportunities not feasible with conventional far-field optical methods. The use of surface plasmon techniques enables excitation of hotspots much smaller than the free-space wavelength; with this confinement, the plasmonic field facilitates trapping of various nanostructures and materials with higher precision. The successful manipulation of small particles has fostered numerous and expanding applications. In this paper, we review the principles of and developments in plasmonic tweezers techniques, including both nanostructure-assisted platforms and structureless systems. Construction methods and evaluation criteria of the techniques are presented, aiming to provide a guide for the design and optimization of the systems. The most common novel applications of plasmonic tweezers, namely, sorting and transport, sensing and imaging, and especially those in a biological context, are critically discussed. Finally, we consider the future of the development and new potential applications of this technique and discuss prospects for its impact on science.},
